### Section 2 : Discovery of HTML

## Create your first HTML page

# IDE code editor
Now is the time to write our first page of HTML code together and display our web page. To do this we will use a code editor. For those who are completely new to a code editor I will keep it very short. I think it's better to show you how it all works, the advantage because it's optimized. 
You can write code with any software, for example a simple notepad. The is that really have to be very strict about syntax, etc. It doesn't have a tool in Notepas that helps you write code. Out of a code editor that's what it's going to do.It'll allow you to enter code like you would in a word processor, but you'll see some small advantages. For example, auto-completion Ã§a va allows you to finish the words you start. The tags will be offered to you. You will have the generation of the closing tag. You will have syntax highlighting to know where there are errors. There are plenty of little advantages.

# IDE install
I will install with you an IDE that I particulary like. It's up to you to choose yours. You can use the same as mine. For those who are just starting out, it may be the easiest. We will go to the Visual Studio Code page.
The advantage of this IDE is that you have several possible versions. You can see it has it for Mac, Linux and Windows. Select the correct OS and click on download. I'm going to run it, double click and I just have to accept the license terms and the default path. I do next twice. I'm going to create an icon, on the desktop, I'm going to add the patch and open Visual Studio Code with a right click on a file. We will install it, we can see that it is finished and we will be able to run Visual Studio Code. I'm going to delete the setup file and I have good Visual Studio that I'm going to be able to run.

# description of the Visual Studio Code Interface
We open, we see an interface that can be scary at first glance that looks complex. I will enlarge the window to the whole screen. On the right you can see a lot of possibilities for language tools, etc. We will be able to close the Welcone window. It's a simple text editor I'll have to make a new file. We can see a file called untitled-1. That's actually his name. We want to save it's HTML. You have some pretty interesting stuff. At the bottom right of the row where you are, we can see the column and the row 1 column 1. Then you have the spaces that we're not really going to use. UTF-8 which is the default UTF-8 encoding, we will not modify it. If you click you can change it, but it's not necessary, espace to quit. Then, what will be very interesting is the language you will use in your page. It is a code editor that will allow you to code between all of its languages.
Logically, we whould put HTML, but we won't have to because we're going to do it. We will simply save our file. For me, I'm going to make a folder on the desktop called HTML CSS course.

# Fake page
Now I will be able to store my files. I go to the top manu in file click on save as. I'm going to go to the office in the HTML and CSS course folder. My first file will be called first.page.html. Don't forget the extension if you haven't filled it in. Now we can see the file path and we have a tab with the file. I will be able to have several files, which will be interesting. Then, I will be able to write my first html page. You could see, I told you about tags. We are not going to use it to make a web page, we must not be hefty. You will see there that I will see what I wrote on my page. I'm going to mark welcome to my first page HTML page. You can see when I write some HTML words here I have some things showing up and it's very interesting. Now that our page is created, we're going to run it to see what it looks like in a browser. I go back to the desktop, I go to open my file and you can see my first page there. I'm going to double click. We can observe that we have : Welcome to my first html page. Why I told you that the IDE was optional because I could very well decided to open the notepad. Simply drag this file into it and you can see I have the content. I could even write : this is a line written from notepad. we save. If now I run my page again, you can see on my HTML page : welcome to my first html page. This is a line written from notepad.

# The advantages of an IDE
We can see that the Visual Studio Code IDE is completely optional. On the other hand, it will have major advantages :

# First, imagine that now create a paragraph.
<p></p>
I will use here my opening angle bracket, my p and my closing angle bracket. You can automatically see that visual studio code generated my closing tag. This called auto-completion : it will also offer you the code syntax of HTML tags. It doesn't stop there you can clearly see that my cursor is well placed in the middle. What is interesting is that I will be able to write this is a paragraph. I go back to the line it's a time saver, in case I forget to close my tag it does it for me.

# emmet
Then, there are other possibilities, it will work with a lot of tags, but you have the possibility for example to use emmet. What's this ? Instead of typing my <img> tag I'm going to type img directly, I'm going to have an abbreviation emmet and I'm going to enter. Look at what the editor does, it offers me two attributes that will be the most common. when using the img tag is src I will store my path and in alt the description of my image. The tag is done, we save time without having to fill in a lot of things. It offers us the interesting tags, so from a syntactical point of view it's interesting and we just have to fill in the attributes.

Another shortcut ctrl + to zoom in and ctrl - to zoom out. Instead of ctrl for mac it's command.

# Structure of an HTML file
I told you about a structure of an HTML file. We start with the html doctype, then the two HTML tags. Then, I'm going to have a head tag and outside of the head tag I'm going to have the body. It's quite painful to type thanks to visual studio code, you can type html with emmet and you choose the second proposal. We can see that this generates the html skeleton of your web page. You can see that there are more things that we haven't seen. There is a language attribute in the html tag which allows you to define the language. The utf-8 encoding, and here we will come back to the meta later and you have a title tag.

You can see that it is very interesting, you have other possibilities. With the magnifying glass on the right you open to search in the documents or to replace thingd that can always be interesting. There you have the source control there, we will use too much in the HTML framework. You have a debugging part which will be interesting to debug your errors. The extension is a store that sill allow you to add lots of extensions that you wouldn't have in it by default. There are plenty of them on the internet.

# install extension
There for example I will install a very practical extension open in a browser and I have the extension. If I click on it I have a summary on the right. It's a new page that's opened in my browser. Let me know how it all works. We use alt + B to open the file in the default browser or shift + alt + B to choose another browser installed on your machine. To install just press install. Once installed, it can be deactivated or uninstalled. It is in my extensions that I have installed on my machine. We will be able to test right away if it works. I go to the html file I do a command + s and I use the key combination they told me to do alt + b. This opens the file in the browser and I can close it.

You have created your first HTML page, I hope you have understood that the code editor will save you time. I will explain to you other quite interesting manipulations to code more easily. Have fewer syntax errors and code faster. Throughout this course because I use Visual Studio Code I will show you as I go. If you have another code editor you will have to document yourself.
