# Section 2 : Discovery of HTML

## The basics of HTML

# HTML syntax
In this section we will focus on the basics. How we can build particular see how HTML works at the syntax level. The syntax is not very complicated because it is a markup language. 
To create a setence in an HTML file, we will simply use tags.

# example tag
<p>Ceci est une phrase</p>
So I hqve a sentence which is <p>Ceci est une phrase</p>. You cane see that I have two <p> tags that have appeared. It is a tag that allows you to write a paragraph in HTML.
This tag we can see that there are two :
- The first is the openening tag
- Then you have the closing tag

For opening the tag, if consist of an opening chevron of the letter, or the name of the tag, in this case p and a closing chevron. 
Then put our sentences, our texts, our paragraphes. When our paragraphs are finished. We will simply use an opening chevron, a slash, the name of the tag and we will close with a closing chevron.

# HTML element
This is in fact a tag that works in pairs: that is to say to that there is an opening tag and are closing tag automatically. 
The difference between the opening and closing tags is the slash. This allows browser what there is between them the opening and closing tags simply a paragraph. So if we take the full content. The tags and the sentence : this is called an HTML element. It is important to understand it well.

# attributes
Then, we will have elements wich are attributes. Attribute are very simple.

<p         </p>
Here our <p> tags. We can see that the opening tag is a little different than usual because I did not put a closing chevron. I have the cloding to tag which is quite classic.

<p class="important"></p>
<p class='important'></p>
I have the closing tag why I did not close tha tag opening tag chevron. If wwe have to add an attribute this is where we should put it. If I use the class attribute. We will see later what it is. I asssign it with the equal sign with single quotes or double quotes that wil also works.

Important means that this paragraph depends on the important class.You don't know what it is yet. The class will wimply allorw you to come back to this pararaph and modifiy your appaearance using CSS. In any case, there a lot of them and we cansse that it is quite simple to use. We will use them by declaring the attributes in the opening tag.

<p class='important'>Ceci est mon paragraphe</p> Then that I did that, I put my text. There it will work, but at the class level you will not see it on the display. HTML knows there is a class attribute called important.

<p class="important"></p>This part is the opening tag. This part is the opening tag. I open my p and instead of closing it directly with the closing it directly with the closing chevron, I will put my attributes there. This is how it will work and here we can observe a closing tag. HTML is going to be just knowing the tags and attributes, etc. By force you will easily retain them. More, I will explain to you : the tags, the attributes.

#  Mozilla Developer Network
We will see the most important, but it is possible that you come across tags that you do not know. I'll give you the address of a site called Mozilla Developer Network : developer.mozilla.org/en/. It is very interesting, this site in fact will allowyou to use the HTML documentation which is more translated.

Once you are on the site you go to the technology level and you choose HTML. So, there we can see on the left menu which will be interesting, you have the documentation and you have all the references. This is what will interest us, if I search here, I ask to display the HTML elements. We can see a list which appeared quite large, which has all the HTML elements. If I go down, as it is listed alphabetically.

We will be able to observe that I have my <p>. If I click on it. This will tell me : the HTML <p> element represents a paragraph of text. Paragraphs are usually represented as blocks and separated by vertical space. We even have an example below, but which contains text we will not deal with it for the moment. If we go down we still have examples, they explain things to us. 

we mainly have the attributes of this tag. In fact, this element like other HTML elements included universal attributes. When there is not really a specific attribute for this tag, you will be able to use the universal attributes. If you are using a tag that has very specific attributes. They will appear there and they will be explained.

If we come back to the level of HTML technologies. We will also be able to observe that below an HTML element. We have the universal attributes we can see a lot of them, which will be quite interesting.

We can discover class, if I click on class : The universal attribute class indicates a list of class accociated width the current element. Thanks to the CSS the we will be able to access the paragraphs which have as attribute  the class : class="note editorial". In our case it was important, if I had assigned this class to several paragraphs. I could thanks to the CSS on the appearence of all the paragraphs just in the CSS, that's pretty interesting.

Another choive that I wanted to point out on the site : it is that you have HTML elements with a small red trash next to it it hat means that it is obsolete and you that means that it is obsolete and that you should avoid using it. This functionality is obsolete : this functionality has been removed from web stardards. Although a few browser can still still support it, it is eradicated. Do not use it in old projects or in new ones. Web pages and applications using it may stop working at any time.

The same way yoi have a blue thumbs down telling you it's not standardized. He tells you : this item is not standard ans should not be used ! To integrate sound into a web we use the <audio> element. Basically it won't necessarily work if you are on internet for everyone to use.

You have everything 
you need here. If you go back to the level of HTML ans attributes. You have some little icons here an experimental tag or attribute which is better not to use it in prodcution. Although the support for this attribbute is not homogeneous for browsers, it is taken into account by machine translation tools (Google translate for example) and translation tools used by translator. More, this this attribute should be used by web authors in order to correctly indicate content that should not translated. You will have understood that it must be used.

Then this Mozilla Developer Network site is going to be of great help to you. If it is not translated you can change it click change the language, you will be at the option at the bottom of the page and you will be able to select it.

# Nested elements
For elements it will not be complicated.
<p>apprendre le<strong> html </strong>c'est facile</p>
You can see here on the screen I still have my paragraph with different text : apprendre le html c'est facile.

<p>apprendre le html c'est facile</p>
Wee see that I have tags for the openin and closing paragraph.

<p>apprendre le<strong> html </strong>c'est facile</p>
You can see insisde that I have nested two strongs tags.
They surround the html textwith the opening tagt on the left with : the opening tgat on the opening chevron, strong  and closing chevron. The closing tag with oeping chevron , slash, closing chevront.

To find out what the strong tag is, go see the documentation that will allow me to put the text in bold. The HTML is going to be there for the content.
The role of CSS is precisely the formatting so for example to put in bold. There you must not see the strong tags as to say I will put my text in bold. Strong tags express semantics. Quite simply the word html has a strong consonance of my sentence so thanks to these tags in CSS. I will be able to apply whatever style I want : leave it in bold, in italics, change the color, etc. This is the point of view of the semantic part. These strong tags, they should not be used just to make bold, even if they do. It is above all to say that this text is important.

<p>apprendre le<strong> html </strong>c'est facile</p>
You can see that I do have the nested strong tags in my paragraph.

<p>apprendre le<strong> html </p>c'est facile</strong>
So be careful if you do this kind of line of code you can. We can see that I have the opening tag this element <p> and <strong> which is inverted do it overlaps. We can see that it does not work.

<p>apprendre le<strong> html </strong>c'est facile</p>
In fact, the beacons work in paird both.
<p><strong></strong></p>.

<p>apprendre le<strong> html </p>c'est facile</strong>
my tag <p> overlaps the tag without being closed <strong> overlaps my closing tag </p> overlaps my closing tag </strong>. You will not have an error in HTML, but you will have an unexpected behavior, a weird display. The first tags is the <p> tag and the browser will understand that it is a pargraph. In the middle I have a strong tag wich is not empty or orphan (here are two types of tags the oairsand the empty ones which are also called orphan) normally a closing tag is needed. You will have a dsiplay problem, but on the other and can see that the paragraphe est bien existant. Warning here to open tag and close it well. If you nest them, be careful that they are inside

# Empty elements
An empty element is quite simply tag that we will say is orphan. We could see that tags worked in pairs. Orphan or empty tags work on their own.

<img src="pictures/equitation.png" alt="Image de cheval" /> 
You can see I have my <img> tag. It is open and we can dearly see the rafter which closes it. Why there are things in the middle, empty tags are used a little differently.

src="pictures/equitation.png"
On the other hand, inside we will slip attributes, like our class. There are different attributes which are often the src attribute here will be reserved for the <img> tag. The src tag is the source and therefore the path to my image. The path will be pictures and the file is called equitation.png.

alt="Image de cheval"
Then you can see a second tag alt, this is what will be said for the visually impaired. If someone is blind, the blind navigate browsers reassure you. They often have reading software reads the page. it's that if you tell the alt attribute, it won't be able to read the image, that's normal. The image will be replaced by the text horse image. This a very important attribute especiallu in the <img> tag.

We will see during this course see all the interesting attributes. Again, help yourself to the documentation. The goal of this course is to make you independent.

# HTML structure
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <title>Mon super site</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>Bienvenue sur mon site web</p>
    </body>
</html>
We will focus on the structure of an HTML file. Its very important. There are several things to see :

<!DOCTYPE html>
- The first thing is that we will find a little special tagt at the top of the file. Opening chevron, exclamation mark, DOCTYPE, further html and closing chevron. The doctype is very important, it corresponds to HTML5 and you will have to fill it in. Why should this Doctype be declared previously you had versions. Now you only have HTML5 but previously we used several versions of HTML at the same time. The doctype was different to tell your browser what follows is HTML 3, 4, 5. The problem of this doctype was rather long to inform. With HTML5 you just have to remember that you enter this doctype every time there is no figure it out. It corresponds to the doctype to say browser is HTML5.

- Then, you can observe two tags an opening and a closing <html></html>. THis is the tag is where we will put all the content of our website.

- Then, you can see two <head></head> tags wich translates into French header, it's going to be the header. Anything that will match the information on the site. For example : the title of the page, we will put meta tags in it. We could put a lot of things there for example : tags, metas so that te site is better indexed on search engines. These are not things that are going to be seen, but that are going to be important.

- Then, we have a second tag just below which is at the same height that we call body which we translate by the body. This will be the body of our message. Here we can see that there is just one paragraph.

What should be remembered is that the structured is that the structure of an HTML page :
- Start with its doctype,
- Then we insert two opening and closing html tags. Inside this tag we will put other tags : 
    - the head therefore the header
    - the body and below the head.

This is a very simple structure, but it is compulsory to know rest assured there are small facilities at the level of the code editors which will allow us not necessarily to have to retain it.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <title>Mon super site</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>Bienvenue sur mon site web</p>
    </body>
</html>
Then, I wanted to talk to you about the importance of indentation. I wrote my <html> tag, the editor draws a line to show that the tags are at the same level. Even if it is lower and some tags are nested.
Between each even tag if we open another <head> tag inside, it will be shifted at the level of the indentation or a tab.

It will allow you in some languages like Python you have to indent correctly because otherwise ther will be errors.

In HTML there is no problem, you will not have any. You will be able to write everything at the same level very well. The problem is, you will very quickly get lost in it. We wee here that it is much more readable : I write my <head> tag inside the <html> tags and that I indent is a very tab. I write my <head> tag, indent to put things that match the section to the head tag.

I do the same with the body those have already made HTML code which is much more readable and if you have to go to your code to maintain or modify it it will be much simpler. We are going to do it because it is very important.
