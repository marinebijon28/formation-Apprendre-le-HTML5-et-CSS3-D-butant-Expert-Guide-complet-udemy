# Section 2 : Discovery of HTML

## The basics of HTML

# HTML syntax
In this section we will focus on the basics. How we can build particular see how HTML works at the syntax level. The syntax is not very complicated because it is a markup language. 
To create a setence in an HTML file, we will simply use tags.

# example tag
<p>Ceci est une phrase</p>
So I hqve a sentence which is <p>Ceci est une phrase</p>. You cane see that I have two <p> tags that have appeared. It is a tag that allows you to write a paragraph in HTML.
This tag we can see that there are two :
- The first is the openening tag
- Then you have the closing tag

For opening the tag, if consist of an opening chevron of the letter, or the name of the tag, in this case p and a closing chevron. 
Then put our sentences, our texts, our paragraphes. When our paragraphs are finished. We will simply use an opening chevron, a slash, the name of the tag and we will close with a closing chevron.

# HTML element
This is in fact a tag that works in pairs: that is to say to that there is an opening tag and are closing tag automatically. 
The difference between the opening and closing tags is the slash. This allows browser what there is between them the opening and closing tags simply a paragraph. So if we take the full content. The tags and the sentence : this is called an HTML element. It is important to understand it well.

# attributes
Then, we will have elements wich are attributes. Attribute are very simple.

<p         </p>
Here our <p> tags. We can see that the opening tag is a little different than usual because I did not put a closing chevron. I have the cloding to tag which is quite classic.

<p class="important"></p>
<p class='important'></p>
I have the closing tag why I did not close tha tag opening tag chevron. If wwe have to add an attribute this is where we should put it. If I use the class attribute. We will see later what it is. I asssign it with the equal sign with single quotes or double quotes that wil also works.

Important means that this paragraph depends on the important class.You don't know what it is yet. The class will wimply allorw you to come back to this pararaph and modifiy your appaearance using CSS. In any case, there a lot of them and we cansse that it is quite simple to use. We will use them by declaring the attributes in the opening tag.

<p class='important'>Ceci est mon paragraphe</p> Then that I did that, I put my text. There it will work, but at the class level you will not see it on the display. HTML knows there is a class attribute called important.

<p class="important"></p>This part is the opening tag. This part is the opening tag. I open my p and instead of closing it directly with the closing it directly with the closing chevron, I will put my attributes there. This is how it will work and here we can observe a closing tag. HTML is going to be just knowing the tags and attributes, etc. By force you will easily retain them. More, I will explain to you : the tags, the attributes.

#  Mozilla Developer Network
We will see the most important, but it is possible that you come across tags that you do not know. I'll give you the address of a site called Mozilla Developer Network : developer.mozilla.org/en/. It is very interesting, this site in fact will allowyou to use the HTML documentation which is more translated.

Once you are on the site you go to the technology level and you choose HTML. So, there we can see on the left menu which will be interesting, you have the documentation and you have all the references. This is what will interest us, if I search here, I ask to display the HTML elements. We can see a list which appeared quite large, which has all the HTML elements. If I go down, as it is listed alphabetically.

We will be able to observe that I have my <p>. If I click on it. This will tell me : the HTML <p> element represents a paragraph of text. Paragraphs are usually represented as blocks and separated by vertical space. We even have an example below, but which contains text we will not deal with it for the moment. If we go down we still have examples, they explain things to us. 

we mainly have the attributes of this tag. In fact, this element like other HTML elements included universal attributes. When there is not really a specific attribute for this tag, you will be able to use the universal attributes. If you are using a tag that has very specific attributes. They will appear there and they will be explained.

If we come back to the level of HTML technologies. We will also be able to observe that below an HTML element. We have the universal attributes we can see a lot of them, which will be quite interesting.

We can discover class, if I click on class : The universal attribute class indicates a list of class accociated width the current element. Thanks to the CSS the we will be able to access the paragraphs which have as attribute  the class : class="note editorial". In our case it was important, if I had assigned this class to several paragraphs. I could thanks to the CSS on the appearence of all the paragraphs just in the CSS, that's pretty interesting.

Another choive that I wanted to point out on the site : it is that you have HTML elements with a small red trash next to it it hat means that it is obsolete and you that means that it is obsolete and that you should avoid using it. This functionality is obsolete : this functionality has been removed from web stardards. Although a few browser can still still support it, it is eradicated. Do not use it in old projects or in new ones. Web pages and applications using it may stop working at any time.

The same way yoi have a blue thumbs down telling you it's not standardized. He tells you : this item is not standard ans should not be used ! To integrate sound into a web we use the <audio> element. Basically it won't necessarily work if you are on internet for everyone to use.

You have everything 
you need here. If you go back to the level of HTML ans attributes. You have some little icons here an experimental tag or attribute which is better not to use it in prodcution. Although the support for this attribbute is not homogeneous for browsers, it is taken into account by machine translation tools (Google translate for example) and translation tools used by translator. More, this this attribute should be used by web authors in order to correctly indicate content that should not translated. You will have understood that it must be used.

Then this Mozilla Developer Network site is going to be of great help to you. If it is not translated you can change it click change the language, you will be at the option at the bottom of the page and you will be able to select it.
