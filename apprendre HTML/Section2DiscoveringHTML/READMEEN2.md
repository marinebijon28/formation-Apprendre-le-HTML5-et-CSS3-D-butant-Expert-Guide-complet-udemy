## Section 2 : Discovering HTML

# How does browser works
We will be interested in the functioning of the web, in particular. To begin with I told you that HTML ans CSS are basis of any website.

# Basic Page in the web
For exa;ple got to page like wikip√©dia : you can observe the presentation, the site is formatted. Behind this side HTML and CSS and moreover other codes. How we will be able to code.

# Display a code
Quite simply from our browser here I use Gooogle Chrome whether you are on Safarie on Mac, Mozilla Firefox, Windows 10 Edge. You will find this option again. You may have to search on google if you do not know how to use it. You right click on the page and display the code for the page. You can see HTML code behind this pqge web. If we go down we can see quite a few. For the moment those who begin it will be gibberish which is quite normal, don't worry.

# How the web works
On your computer you have at least one browser installed. This browser if you git it a URL for example www.TF1.fr. The browser will send this request on the internet saying I want to contact www.TF1.fr. Jim going to simplify things a lot because it still has an extra step. That's when you tape www.TF1.fr. We call it a domain name. The computer does'nt like that. It works with IPs.

# IP
It is a block of four digitd thqt go from 1 to 256.So it is obvious that the TF1 site is hosted on an IP. For example : 88.96.122.12. It'much easier to remember www.tf1.fr. 

# DNS
It is the role of the DNS servers that you access provider will query. So there is research being done.
It is simply transmits the publics IP of the TF1 website.

# The browser processes the data
The browser works with IPs. To keep things simple, I removed the DSN part.

# Box
Your browser on through your box ans asks for the page TF1.fr. Once this is done, you will contact the web servers that host TF1. 

# Web server
It's a very poweful big computer. We have can have server farms. If you take know server like OVH, One And One, etc. There you have whole rooms with servers wich are in bays rather in rack, in line where there is no screen

# web server processing
In fact it's a big server that will host your website ans distribute it to people. WHen there is request made by www.tf1.fr. Contact the web server that hosts the TF1 site. What he will do is send you the HTML code for page. In this case the home page becausw I did not sepcify a URL.I touch the index of the TF1. At the server level, it returns HTML CSS, and sometimes other code in at well

# How it works at the browser level
Your browser receives this code. He will come and display it taking into beacon the tags. The <p></p>tags will form a paragraph, <img/> which will go get the image, and the part between the <style></style>. It receives the HTML and CSS code and it interprets. He will bring out the tags and he knows that the matter thanks to CSS. Therefore it will position change its appearance it will display the HTML and CSS content so you can see that it is bot very complicated.

# What we're gonna do 
Now what we're going to do is learn how to use HTML and CSS in this course. To learn how tocreate our own page.
